#### Experience
- Sr. Data Scientist (Operations Research) — Jan 2019 – Present
  - Grocery Profiling
      - Translated VBA-based grocery profiling logic to Java
  - Ocean Procurement Optimization
      - Built mixed-integer-programming-based optimization engine to help Global Logistics Team with selecting international carriers to cover company global procurement demands for fiscal year 2020. Established comprehensive and flexible interface to allow users incorporating various operational/service considerations and constraints.
      - Facilitated managerial decision making throughout over 100 rounds of fast-paced bidding process by presenting optimization results, explaining optimization logic and incorporating new service constraints in real time.
      - Optimization process resulted in significant labor hour reduction, balanced carrier/alliance allocation per lane and about 30 million operational cost savings.
      - Skills used: Excel (for data input and output), Java and Cplex (for optimization)
- Data Scientist (Operations Research) — Aug 2016 – Jan 2019
  - Driver Tractor Assignment Optimization
      - Built column-generation-based optimization engine to assign drivers to tractors in order to minimize driver split-seat, maximize tractor utilization and prioritize drivers with bigger longevity.
      - Went through numerous iterations of model and code upgrade to reduce runtime from hours to seconds and support rollout to all dispatching offices of Walmart private fleet, resulting in approximately 4 million labor cost savings and 8 million operational cost savings annually.
      - Skills used: Java (for column generation part using multi-threading), Cplex (for solving master problem)
  - Assortment Optimization
      - Participating in internal company-wise Id8 competition, implemented a column-generation-based optimization engine that’s able to estimate store-level customer purchase probability based on historical transaction data.
      - Built a mixed-integer programming engine to decide optimal offer set for each category at store level.
      - Algorithm taken by internal assortment optimization team and internal startup Store No.8 for further research and development.
      - Skills used: Java, Cplex
  - Truckload Optimization
      - Rewrote key legacy truckload optimization COBOL code in Java, reducing data processing runtime from 10 minutes to 10 seconds.
      - Implemented logic to process gigabytes of input data into individual optimization data module; created initial optimization model and implemented baseline optimization code; implemented heuristic algorithms to solve instances with large amount of orders, resulting in saving of 14 trucks daily.
      - Skills used: Java, Cplex
  - Safety Stock Optimization
      - Worked on implementation and validation of next generation inventory optimization model for Walmart U.S. and achieved 8% improvement over the current system during pilot store testing. – Lead data platform migration from Teradata to Hadoop, responsible for data ETL and Hive query implementation.
      - Skills used: R, Hive, Shell Scripting
  - Frontend Optimization
      - Translated SQL into Hive and implemented shell scripts to run Hive scripts on a monthly basis.
      - Skills used: Hive, Shell Scripting
- Global Business Process Intern — May 2016 – Jul 2016
  - Safety Stock Optimization
- Ph.D. Candidate and Research Assistant — Aug 2012 – May 2016
  - Multi-day Vehicle Routing with Service Consistency
      - Proposed an improved multi-directional local search algorithm to study the tradeoff between service consistency optimization and travel cost minimization.
      - Implemented multiple traditional and state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms to conduct performance comparison on approximating Pareto frontier.
      - Skill used: C++
  - Periodic Vehicle Routing with Service Consistency
      - Studied the tradeoff between service consistency optimization and travel cost minimization in the context of periodic vehicle routing problems.
      - Implemented multiple metaheuristic algorithms to approximate Pareto frontier.
      - Skill used: C++
  - Consistent Vehicle Routing with Branch-and-Price
      - Proposed a branch-and-price formulation for the consistent vehicle routing problem in which driver consistency and arrival time consistency are strictly enforced.
      - Implemented a branch-and-bound algorithm with column generation process at each tree node to find the optimal solutions for benchmarking instances.
      - Skill used: C++, Cplex
