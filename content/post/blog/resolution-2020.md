It is about time to put down THE new year resolution for 2020, a yearly ritual with no long-lasting meaning and without it, life seems devoid of purpose.
Consider it a one-year long experiment and see how it ends up the same time next year when I sit down to review this.

## Reading

Reading is a noble thing, but too high a target spells the failure from the beginning, so the goal is,

+ 20 books
  + That's about one book every two weeks, not too much pressure and thirty minutes every day should suffice to cover it.
+ 10 book reviews
  + Reading without thinking is fruitless. I'll try to write and save more of my understanding to see how it evolves over time.

Like in an optimization problem, the constraint is that there should be at least two books in each of the categories: psychology, investing and economy.
The point is that I'll aim to understand more about myself and how the world works.

## Skills

A professional should never stop hone his/her skills.
Next year will come with new projects, which brings about opportunities to exercise different skills, but the core competency should always come from core skills.
With that in mind, the goal in this category is,

+ C++
  + Read and digest the book *C++ Primer*
+ Data structure and algorithm
  + Understand and practice at least two core data structures

## Blogging

Learning without regular output is inefficient at best.
I'll aim to write more often to share my understanding of topics in improving the core skills.
The goal in this category is,

+ 10 articles about C++
  + Anything related to C++ is fine, use it as a notebook to save new learnings for future reference.
  + Update log
        + [Data types]({{< ref "../cpp/cpp-data-types.md" >}})
+ 10 articles about optimization
  + Mostly about essential algorithms in operations research. Writing things in a clear and easy to understand way is best to full grasp a concept.

## English

New words have become a roadblock in my acquisition of knowledge through reading books.
The purpose here is to gradually increase my vocabulary size over the span of multiple years, and the goal is,

+ 1200 new words
  + That's about 100 words every month. I'll see how it goes.

## Exercise

This should have been put as the first item in the list, physical health is the foundation of everything else after all, and the goal is,

+ at least twice times a week

## Growth

Weekly and monthly reflection is beneficial for person growth and I should do it more often, the ultimate goal is,

+ weekly and monthly reflection

## Update Log

I'll come back frequently to review my progress and update items that have been completed.
It'd be interesting to see the journey next year.
