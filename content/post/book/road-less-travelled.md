| [*The Road Less Traveled*](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Less-Traveled-Timeless-Traditional/dp/0743243153) by *M. Scott Peck*  | 5 / 5 |

This is probably the best book I've read so far this year.
It talks about mental growth and is very thought-provoking.
I set up a new-year resolution of reading 20 books in 2019 and I've achieved that goal after finishing this book.
Reflecting upon the short journey of intensive book reading in the past few months, it is still mysterious to me why I was able to stick to it without much struggling.
I've attempted to read more books in the past and failed eventually. 
Although graduated with a Ph.D. degree in engineering, I always consider myself illiterate outside my own domain. 
Somehow earlier this year I decided to read more books and felt intrigued by the experience. 
After reading about ten books on iPad, I bought a Kindle to give myself an incentive to continue reading, which also helps relieve my eye fatigue when reading in dark.
I used to play some video games on my phone for relaxation after work and at the same time constantly felt consciously uneasy of wasting time by doing it, which turned out not to be a good way of recharging my energy. 
Video games consume more energy since I have to focus intensively in order to win, only to find myself exhausted in another form after playing for half an hour.
There ought to be a better, more nurturing way to spend time after work, and I am glad I've found it.


Lots of people, voluntarily or involuntarily, stop mental growth when they reach a certain stage of their lives.
I was one of them for a long time, with the misconception of studying as the same thing with growth.
It seems to me now that studying is a very narrow-minded way of acquiring knowledge in specific areas, and often in a passive way.
It's common for Chinese students to spend years of their adolescence years to sit in classroom and study math, english, physics and others, but that studying is to learn basic and fundamental facts of how things work, involving very little efforts for mental growth.
Moreover, the learning is often in a passive way, with no clear objective of what the knowledge is for.
Sometimes I feel I am lucky since that I spent lots of efforts in studying all those subjects in school without considering why I did them, and I was able to see a broader world because of it.
Lots of my peers gave up in the process and had I given up like them, I am probably working in the countryside like my parents or some manufacturing factories like some of my childhood friends.
I am not suggesting that working as farmers and factory workers is any less valuable than working in a corporate, it's just that books gave me another chance to experience a difference life than my parents and grandparents.
Book essentially changed my life.

Inevitably we run into other problems right after we solve one.
I grew more anxious after I graduated and worked in industry for a while and life always presented too many problems, and all in one time.
The video gaming was essentially a coward way of tackling problems by running away from them.
It is a sign of weak mental strength to confront various problems by retreating to a virtual world, but whatever it ends up with is not real and does not last long.
The instant strategy game I played takes about three minutes for each round, and it is very compelling to keep playing: I wanted to win the next one if I lost and I wanted to keep winning if I won one, like gambling in many aspects. 
Book reading, on the other hand, can be very intriguing too.
Many times I didn't realize times pass when I immersed myself into pages.
It feels like my mind has longed for nutrition and finally gets what it craves for, and mental growth happens along the way.
Books in this sense changed my life again.


This book is more that just mental growth. 
It covers lots of stuff, some of which I don't understand yet, and I'll probably come back to it later.
One particular point that is made clear in this book is that childhood experience plays a huge role in a person's mental health in later life.
Lots of people seeking psychotherapy eventually find that it is their miserable early-life experience that contributes and shapes the way they think about and react to stimuli from outside world when they grow up.
Parenting can be struggling and it itself should be a sign of healthy relationship between parents and kids, as long as parents make mental efforts to work on it.
The last part of the book covers science and religion, providing a new way of looking at them.
Science, from the author's perspective, is also a religion, conforming to certain rules that scientists believe, which is similar to what theists do, christians or buddhists alike.
I find this part less interesting, probably due to my current limited interests in this subject.
Overall, it is a very enlightening book to read.
