I have to admit that I have a penchant to procrastinate, on lots of things.
Though I am aware of what I am doing most of the time, I can sometimes, subconsciously,  fall foul of life, which is fraught with responsibilities that I cannot sidestep.
Work, study, family all demand constant attentions and energies.
This book, [Someday Is Not a Day in the Week](https://www.amazon.com/Someday-Not-Day-Week-Hacks/dp/1250201225), is a good read in the sense that it reveals an ugly fact: someday only lives in our mind and is never a day in the week.

Someday may be the greatest ever invention by dreamers who have ambitions as high as heavens.
It is the pilgrimage place where one meets his best self.
Sadly, the reality turns out to be as thin as paper for most people who fail to put dreams into action.
To my chagrin, I might be in this unwitting stage of dreaming as well.

The author proposes a strategy consisting of a series of steps to tackle this.
There are too many of them and I doubt there will be anyone ever following the instructions step by step.
The best system should be simple and straightforward to follow.
However, there are indeed some important takeaways. 
First, evaluation of where we are on the path to success or happiness.
It is too easy to live a day perfunctorily, not realizing that it also represents a unique opportunity to do something towards our dream.
I particularly like the quote in the book that "today is the only day we have for sure and we should live it accordingly".
Too often we assume we will wake up again tomorrow and we still have time.
There is a caveat for this assumption, especially if one lives in U.S. where accidents and violence is ubiquitous.

Second, initiate an action today.
It happens sometimes to me that I have no idea what I am gonna do for the day on my way driving to work in the morning.
It is a perilous sign signaling an aimless day, which insidiously pushes someday further in the future.
I find a to-do list suits me well as it shows a detailed list of doable items I should focus on for the rest of the day.
The item on the list should not be too vague, something like "work on project A" will usually ends up nowhere as the results are not measurable.
To point is to create actionable items with clearly stated goals for today.
If I find an item too value, I will further break it down into smaller items.



Last, integrate your passion with profession. 
I consider myself lucky as I love my vocation and I am passionate about my work, which is also part of the reasons that wake me up early in the morning and go to work.
This book brings up a good point of identifying an avocation that can be integrated with the vocation.
It seems daunting to conjure a avocation besides the demanding daily job, but it's worth trying.
If we can break someday and makes it part of everyday living, we may meet our dream in the middle of the path.
