This book tells a story of Amir and his friend/servant/half-brother Hassan growing up in Afghanistan, parting their ways by crime, betrayal and war, and somewhat reuniting decades after in U.S.
It is a story about family bond between father and son, friendship between master and servant, and personal growth through guilt and redemption.
It is depressing as well as invigorating to read along as the story unveils itself in the pages.

Initially, it is hard to believe that Amir, the only son of his Baba, could be jealous of Hassan, the son of Baba's servant Ali.
Amir has everything Hassan could be aspiring for, an upper-class family provided by his Baba's successful business, an opportunity to study in school and lots of toys other kids may only dream of. 
Hassan is just the humble son of Ali, the family servant growing up with Baba. 
It turned out that Amir craved for his father's approval all the times but got constantly denied, partly because Amir's birth came with his mother's death and Amir grew up to be nowhere close to the expectation of Baba. 
As every child naturally tends to seek his/her parents' attention, Amir was no exception and eventually believed that Hassan was in the way of getting Baba's dedicated attention, which made him set Hassan up for stealing accusation, the biggest sin of all according to Baba's standard. 
We may all do absurd and even unethical things when inundated by certain inner desire, and Amir's 'crime' is, to some extend, understandable. 


Baba may be a honorable men to many people but he failed badly as a father, who never spent time recognizing Amir's unique talents or had the courage to confront the truth toward Hassan.
I recently read another book, the road less traveled, and came to realize that Baba deprived Amir, at least in his early years of childhood, of essential and critical parental love.
Baba seemingly provided everything for Amir, but it could not substitute the deserved parental attention, only through which true influence could happen.
Baba wanted Amir to be more courageous to be able to defend himself when times came, but too often he saw disappointment.
Hassan was more like Baba in many ways but didn't get the recognition either.
All those honorable things Baba did were essentially self-centered delusions that served as the only purpose of shying away from his true responsibility as a real honorable man and a long-due father, for both Amir and Hassan.
It seems that Hassan acted for his whole life more honorable than Baba.
He contributed more to Amir's spiritual growth by constantly standing up and fighting for Amir, and always forgiving what Amir's misdeeds.
Although Amir may never saw Hassan as his real friend, his eventual heroic act of saving Hassan's son out of Afghanistan was a manifestation of Hassan's ever-lasting influence on him.


This book is invigorating to read in the sense that it shows a journey of spiritual growth through guilt and redemption.
Although it takes tremendous courage to save Sohrab, Hassan's son, from war, it requires more conscious effort and energy to regain Sohrab's trust after he committed suicide due to the fear of being abandoned. 
Sohrab remained silent for years but Amir never lost hope to rekindle his passion to start a new life.
It is again proved that, given enough attentions, a genuine love from a parental role can deeply nourish a child's minds to a point that they will thrive again.
We all can learn from our past experience through conscious self-examination and constructive criticism. 
Amir might be coward when he was young, but he eventually became a real man.
