[Far From the Tree](https://www.amazon.com/Far-Tree-How-Children-Differences/dp/1481440918/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=far+from+the+tree&qid=1567785953&s=gateway&sr=8-5) is a very thought-provoking book written by Andrew Solomon, which zooms in on subcultures that are often overlooked by society at large.
The author looks into people with blindness, deafness, schizophrenia, birth out of rape, etc. and reveals realities that are not only informational, but also inspiring. 
It is not just disabilities or abnormalities that make people stand out, those talented also create an unique phenomenon in our society as they are often referred to as prodigies.

We homo sapiens are good at labeling, from identifying whether some roadside fruits are edible or determining whether certain unfamiliar animals are dangerous to trigger fight or flight, to instantly mark someone we just met as tall or short, nice or grim, handsome or bland.
While creating multiple labels of people on first encounter subconsciously, we build first impressions of them, which has a long-lasting effect on how we are to interact with them in the future.
There is no difference in the way people see the groups discussed in the book as special, it is human instincts at play.

From personal experience, I still remember in my high school years when lots of students were bespectacled and I would intentionally hunch over the desk sometimes with the hope to become myopic.
My frivolous attempt eventually came to fruition, an achievement I regret for the rest of my life.
The point I am trying to make here is that we tend to converge to a state to avoid standing out from our surrounding group, another instinct inherited from our ancestors in ancient times when standing out was tantamount to voluntarily wiping oneself out of the gene pool.
When wearing glasses was a environmental norm, having healthy vision became a negative label and the influence could be so insidious that the rash decisions we made could backlash against us in later stage of life.

The author defines two terms - vertical identity and horizontal identity.
The former refers to the attributes and values passed down from parents to children across generations; while the latter refers to the inherent or acquired traits that a person possesses and don't share with his parents. 
For example, my kids have a vertical identity of being a Chinese as both my wife and I were born and grew up in China.
We speak Chinese at home and enjoy Chinese food every day (not every meal though, as we do eat pizza sporadically).
On the other hand, they acquire the horizontal identify of being Chinese American, simply due to the fact that they live in U.S. these years.
What they are going to experience is totally foreign to me.

Is having a horizontal identity a good or bad thing? Similar to the answer to many other questions, it depends.
The key, in my opinion, lies in one's upbringing.
Wearing glasses is probably no big deal for most parents, although it does incur a bit of financial expenditure and close some opportunities when good vision is required.
Being a prodigy or gay, or blind or deaf, is another story and poses bigger challenge for parents.
I don't have the perfect answer, but I believe awareness is the first step.
Sometimes parents are simply ignorant of their children's struggles, parenting is more of a perfunctory routine they carry on every day.
Other times, parents will overlook issues due to lack to experience.
I would expect my kids will encounter lots of struggles I can not imagine at this point of time.
Next is the attitude towards the horizontal identity.
Parents need to decide whether to deny it or to embrace it.
Both are understandable but the latter should be the right way to go.

The identities or labels we have change perpetually.
Life is like strolling along an ocean beach, collecting little rocks randomly, some we don't like and some bring us delight. What's important is that we keep walking.
