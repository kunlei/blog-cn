I picked up this book, [The Psychology of Wealth](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Wealth-Understand-Relationship-Prosperity/dp/0071789294/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1570020768&sr=1-1), randomly from a library shelf, with the hope to peek at the perspective of how financially successful people look at wealth.
It turned out to be a boring read.
It seems that author tries to use some anecdotes to convey a point, which is still cryptic to me after I finish reading the book.
In the first some chapters, the author repeatedly refers to stories of one or two successful people, which makes it more like a biography.
Also many times I don't get how the stories stand to support his point.
In one example, the author mentions that his grandparent sets big store on buying and wearing nice clothes, it sounds amusing and shallow.
Anyway, stay way from the book and don't randomly pick books anymore.
