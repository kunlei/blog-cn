This book discusses how the internet usage is shaping our brains as we integrate with it closely in our daily lives.
A key point the author tries to deliver is that our brains are not fixed as we grow up, instead, they constantly adapt to new stimuli through developing new connections between neurons, while diminishing other existing connections.
This resonates with another book I read a long while ago, which talks about fixed mindset and growth mindset.
Basically, people with fixed mindset believe that skills cease to develop after a certain age, while people with growth mindset think they can acquire new skills as long as they desire.
Naturally, our brains must be able to grow/change if we were to acquire new skills.
This has two implications, good growth and bad growth, depending on what we feed our brains.
On the one hand, if we realize the possible negative impact of internet usage on our brains, we could consciously exert ourselves more to separate from it and do something else more beneficial, like reading and exercising. 
On the other hand, our brains could easily slide into new habits of surfing the internet for hours without accomplishing anything if we allow ourselves doing so.

The book recognizes that the internet, just like other technological advances happened in the past century, is irreversible. 
What it promotes is not totally abandon its usage, but more of increasing our awareness towards its impact on our minds.
One example in the book is that people used to modern navigational applications like google maps unconsciously lose the opportunity to develop the skills.
This particularly applies to me, as I often think of myself having no sense of direction.
Sometimes, I do feel it is self-fulfilling in the sense that the more I think of it that way, the less effort I spend on improving my navigational skill and hence rely more on google maps.
However, I also believe one's mental energy is limited, exercising one skill will essentially consume time which could be used somewhere else.
It is a mental decision how we want to focus our energy on.

The author argues that what we do and even what we think determine what we are.
I became a morning person since I started to get up early and ever since going back.
I might still be the same person on the first day I got up on 5am instead of usually 7am, but some neurons must have been created within my brain which had been reinforced in the following days.
Now I don't need an alarm to wake up every day around 5am.
Were I to develop a reverse habit of staying in bed for another hour in the morning, other neuron connections surely would have been created to adapt to that pattern.
Similarly, a person who worries a lot will trick his brain to create more and more worrying neuron connections that only serve to exacerbate that mental process.

Overall, I think this book is a good read.
