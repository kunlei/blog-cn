[All the Wrong moves](https://www.amazon.com/All-Wrong-Moves-Ruining-Everything/dp/0385545177) is a delightful book in which the author enthuses about his passion and failure of playing chess.
It's a fun read even for someone, like me, who has no chess experience.
The author experience epitomizes an old Chinese proverb that goes something like 'a man is doomed to fail if he chooses to compete in the wrong field'.
The author is clearly very enthusiastic about playing chess but eventually has to accept the fact that he can never be a master player.
He details his journey to this eventual 'fate' acceptance in a hilarious way, and I particularly like the part where the author attends a tournament in India, during which he loses due to various amusing reasons. 

On one hand, I greatly admire the author's writing style.
It seems daunting to write a book about chess to general readers, considering the fact that not many readers have the first-hand experience playing it.
The author recounts his experience with chess in an eloquent way that makes me want to learn how to play chess and feel its purity.
It's a bit challenging for me to read because there are so many new words for me on every singe page.
The author is clearly a master of language than chess.

On the other hand, the impression I have on the way the author learns chess is that it might not be the best way to learn something new.
The author touts the idea that mastering chess is mostly for prodigy player, supported by anecdotes of some grandmasters with preternatural abilities. 
For one, the author starts his journal of playing chess in a less competitive environment and never seems to have the opportunity to get professional training to build the foundation.
It is mentioned a couple of times in the book that the author spends lots of times playing chess online and progresses in a self-teaching way.
Having great teachers or mentors is pivotal to one's achievement in almost any field.
Not only do they point us the right way to focus our energy on, they also save us from going awry in the learning path, which is hard to correct in later stage.
Also improving skills in complicated vocation like chess required deliberate practice. 
Long hours of playing is hardly useful without conscious plan to review and improve.
The author also mentions that he often plays late into the night, which I seriously doubt how much it can contribute to acquiring better chess skills, or any skills.
It only creates an illusion of working hards and later resentment of no progress after this intense devotion and sacrifice.

Reading this book also makes me wonder what wrong moves I am making now that I am not aware of.
Doing self inspection is hard and often futile, since we never know whether what we are doing is part of future success or mere step towards something that never comes to fruition.
However, it is still important to ruminate the way we carry out our routines.
Are we doing something out of habit or is it part of the deliberate practice?
Shying away from the question will take a heavy toll on us in the long run.
For example, maintaining this blog might be just a waste of time if not enough efforts are spent to keep it organized and helpful.
On the other hand, if doing well, it could be a great way to improve my skills, by routinely summarizing and explaining knowledge I learned to greater audience.
After all, sharing is one of the best ways to learning.
